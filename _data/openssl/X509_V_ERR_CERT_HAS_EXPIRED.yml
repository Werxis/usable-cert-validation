  The certificate has expired (its validity period passed).
  
  #### Explanation
  
  Every certificate is issued for a specific time period (determined by `notBefore` and `notAfter` fields in the certificate). The current time seems to be past the `notAfter` value. Therefore, the certificate is no longer valid.
  
  #### Security perspective
  
  The certificate is not valid anymore. That means the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) does guarantee the information in it is still correct. Moreover, expired certificates are removed from Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). That means the certificate might have been revoked in the past (e.g., because of a leaked private key), but we cannot check anymore. Thus, the server presenting this certificate may not be who it claims.
  
  #### Next steps
  
  First, ensure that the date, time and time zone are set correctly on your device to eliminate the possibility of local misconfiguration. If the time settings are correct, you should get a new valid certificate from the CA.
