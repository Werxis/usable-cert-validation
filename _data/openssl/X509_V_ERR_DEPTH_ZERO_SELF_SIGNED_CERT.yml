  The provided certificate is self-signed and it is not present in the list of trusted certificates.
  
  #### Explanation
  
  The provided certificate is self-signed (the `issuer` and `subject` fields are the same). Self-signed certificates usually serve as the root of trust in certificate chains belonging to the Certificate Authorities (CA). However, this certificate is at "zero depth," i.e., it does not form a certificate chain. Neither is it present in the list of explicitly trusted CAs in your system.
  
  #### Security perspective
  
  Anyone can issue a self-signed certificate. Thus, the information contained in the certificate is not reliable. Therefore, the server presenting this certificate may not be who it claims.
  
  #### Next steps
  
  Try to find out if the self-signed certificate was expected at this place. Try to get a proper CA-signed certificated as self-signed certificates are not recommended even for testing purposes. If you are _absolutely certain_ this is the certificate issued by a trustworthy party, you can mark it as trusted by your system.
