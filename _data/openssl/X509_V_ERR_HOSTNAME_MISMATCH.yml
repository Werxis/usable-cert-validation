  The requested hostname does not match the subject name in the certificate.
  
  #### Explanation
  
  Information about the certificate's subject (an entity associated with the certificate's public key) is held in the `subjectAltName` extension or the `subject` field. However, the hostname of the server you are connecting to does not match the subject information in the certificate.
  
  #### Security perspective
  
  You cannot verify the identity of the server to which you are connecting â€“ you should not proceed. The server is either providing a wrong certificate (by being misconfigured) or is deliberately pretending to be a different entity to fool you. Sending or receiving data from unknown servers may put your systems at risk.
  
  #### Next steps
  
  Compare the server hostname with the `subjectAltName` extension and the `subject` field of the certificate. Common misconfigurations include not including server aliases in the certificate (e.g., `www.example.com` for the server `example.com`).
