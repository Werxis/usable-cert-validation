  The certificate's key is being used for a different purpose than allowed.
  
  #### Explanation
  
  Certificates can be used for various purposes. It might be desirable to use a certificate only for specific purposes. This is achieved by the `keyUsage` extension, which defines nine possible usages of the certificate (e.g., `digitalSignature` or `dataEncipherment`). End entity certificates can also specify the extended key uses (in the `extKeyUsage` extension).
  
  #### Security perspective
  
  Using the certificate for the purpose forbidden in the certificate may pose a risk to your data or systems. (For example, the key's security may not be sufficient for the forbidden use).
  
  #### Next steps
  
  Check both the `keyUsage` and `extKeyUsage` to see if the listed purposes include the one for which you are attempting to use the certificate.
