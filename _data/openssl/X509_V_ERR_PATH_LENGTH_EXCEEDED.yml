  The allowed length of the certification path was exceeded.
  
  #### Explanation
  
  Certification Authorities (CAs) can mandate the maximal length of the trusted certificate chains below their certificate. This is done using the `pathLenConstraint` field in the `basicConstraints` extension. If the certificate chain created during validation is longer than this limit, the validation fails due to the violated path length constraint. This limit includes only intermediate certificates â€“ the first (CA) and the last (endpoint) certificates are excluded.
  
  #### Security perspective
  
  An exceeded certificate path length signifies that one of the sub-authorities issued a certificate it was not allowed. Therefore, the CA or one of the sub-authorities may not be trustworthy.
  
  #### Next steps
  
  Inspect the certificate chain to find the `pathLenConstraint` in the `basicConstraints` extension that was violated. Inform the (sub-)authority issuing this certificate about the violation lower in the certificate chain.
