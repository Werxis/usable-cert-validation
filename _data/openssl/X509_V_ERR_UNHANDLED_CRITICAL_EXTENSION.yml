  A critical extension was not recognized or could not be processed.
  
  #### Explanation
  
  Certificate extensions can be used for extending certificates with additional information. Each extension is either marked as critical or non-critical (in the `critical` field in the extension). If an extension is marked as critical, it must be processed. If the processing system cannot recognize or process a critical extension, it must reject the certificate.
  
  #### Security perspective
  
  Marking an extension as critical is a way for the certificate issuer to denote it is _absolutely essential_ to process and understand it. If it is not processed, we may lack the necessary information and misuse the certificate. We may, for example, miss the intended purpose or key usage constraint. Inappropriateong usage circumvents the guarantees of the certificate authority, possibly putting our systems at risk.
  
  #### Next steps
  Inspect the certificate extensions marked with `critical: true` to find the offender. Make sure that only the necessary extensions are marked as critical. Marking non-standard extensions as critical may cause problems in the general context.
